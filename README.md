# hmap: Python Heatmap Package

This package implements a convenient heatmap plotting package in python. It offers low level functions for

1. Plotting
	- Heatmaps
	- Dendrograms
	- Annotations
	- Legends
2. Figure layouting

## Figure layout
The hmap package comes with a module for defining the layout of a figure using absolute length measurements. Currently the only unit supported is mkilimeters. The layout of a figure is defined as a grid. You have to specify 
- the number of rows, 
- the number of columns, 
- the widths of the columns,
- the heights of the rows,
- the vertical distance between adjacent rows, 
- the horizontal distance between adjacent columns,
- the size of the bottom border margin,
- the size of the top border margin,
- the size of the left border margin, and
- the size of theright border margin
As said before, the sizes are given in milimeters.

### Example

```python
import sys
import hmap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, gs = hmap.layout.layout.layoutGrid(4, 5, [10., 2., 40., 40., 40], [10., 2., 40., 40.], 1., 1., 20., 15., 15., 20.)
col_widths = ["10 mm", "2 mm", "40 mm", "40 mm", "40 mm"]
row_heights = ["10 mm", "2 mm", "40 mm", "40 mm"]

for row_idx in range(4):
    for col_idx in range(5):
        ax = plt.subplot(gs[row_idx, col_idx])
        plt.xticks([], [])
        plt.yticks([], [])
        if(row_idx == 0):
            ax.xaxis.set_label_position("top")
            plt.xlabel(col_widths[col_idx], 
                       fontsize=7, 
                       rotation=90)
        if(col_idx == 0):
            plt.ylabel(row_heights[row_idx], 
                       fontsize=7, 
                       rotation=0, 
                       horizontalalignment="right",
                       verticalalignment="center")
```

# Installation
```bash
pip install hmap
```

# Usage Example
Please check the [jupyter notebook](jupyter_notebooks/hmap_example.ipynb) for an example of how to use hmap.

This package was implemented during my time at the *German Cancer Research Center* in the group of *Theoretical Bioinformatics* headed by Prof. Dr. Roland Eils, where i was part of the core bioinformatics team of the *Heidelberg Institute of Personalized Oncology (HIPO)*. Further refinment and final upload to PyPI was done during my time at *Charite, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) in the Department of Digital Health* headed by Prof. Roland Eils.
